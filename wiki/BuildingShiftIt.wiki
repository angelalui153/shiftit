As of check-in version #22, Shift It cannot be built alone. You will have to configure Shift It to include the Sparkle.Framework. 

* To make ShiftIt build, you would have just follow these two steps:
    # Download the [http://sparkle.andymatuschak.org/ Sparkle Framework]  
    # Copy the Sparkle.Framework file and paste in the ShiftIt Folder

*NOTE: Check for Updates and Automatically Update functions will not work if you do not configure the application for  Sparkle Framework.*
