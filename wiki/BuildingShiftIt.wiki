=== Important changes ===
As of check-in version #22, Shift It cannot be built alone. You will have to configure Shift It to include the Sparkle.Framework. 

* To make ShiftIt build, you would have just follow these two steps:
    # Download the [http://sparkle.andymatuschak.org/ Sparkle Framework]  
    # Copy the Sparkle.Framework file and paste in the ShiftIt Folder

==== Check for Updates and Automatically Update functions ====
Since "Check for Updates" and "Automatically Update" functions are dependent on the Sparkle Framework, these functions will not work if you do not modify the ShiftIt-Info.plist file. For detailed changes, please refer to [http://wiki.github.com/andymatuschak/Sparkle/ Sparkle Framework Documentation]
